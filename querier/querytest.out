Creating counters and inserting test keys...
ctr1:{6=9, 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, }
ctr2:{6=9, 1=2, 2=2, 4=4, }
testing intersection...
printing intersection of ctr1 and empty counters...
should be empty
{}
	6 intersects
	1 intersects
	2 intersects
printing intersection of ctr1 and ctr2...
should be have keys: 6,9 and 2,2, 1,1
{6=9, 1=1, 2=2, }
testing merging...
merged empty counter to ctr1, printing ctr1...
should be unchanged
{6=9, 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, }
	6 exists
	1 exists
	2 exists
	4 added
merged ctr2 to ctr1, printing ctr1...
should be have keys: 6,18, 2,4, 1,3, 4,4, 3,3
{6=18, 1=3, 2=4, 3=3, 4=4, }
